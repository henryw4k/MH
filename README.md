# Merchant hub test project

THis repository is created to test Angular2 for merchant hub, setting up our Angular workflow standards and more.
This repository holds the TypeScript source code of the [angular.io quickstart](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html),
the foundation for most of the documentation samples and potentially a good starting point for your application.

It's been extended with testing support so you can start writing tests immediately.

**This project should not include any actual MH code.
